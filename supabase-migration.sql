Happy Birthday. I don''t have a gift wrapped in a box, but I wrapped this website with care â€” every page is a small piece of how you make my days better.

We''ve only known each other a short while, but you''ve already become someone I think about often. Your smile, your laugh, and the things you love (like Kanade) tell me who you are â€” gentle, strong, and quietly beautiful.

I hope this little book makes you smile. I made it because I wanted you to know you matter â€” more than you might realize.

Always,
