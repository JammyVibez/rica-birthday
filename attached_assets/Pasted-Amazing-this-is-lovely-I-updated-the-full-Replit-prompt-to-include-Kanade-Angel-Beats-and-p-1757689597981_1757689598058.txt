Amazing — this is lovely. I updated the full Replit prompt to include **Kanade (Angel Beats)** and polished everything so you can paste it once into Replit AI and get a ready-to-edit site. I also included ready-to-use **compliments**, a **short poem/letter**, and a short **pre-message** you can send her before revealing the site. Finally, I added a few casual questions to ask Rica if you want more details to personalize the site even more.

# 1) Final single prompt to paste to Replit AI

```
Build me a beautiful, interactive birthday website for a girl named Rica. 
The website should be a mini digital birthday book with multiple pages navigable using “Next” and “Back” buttons. 
Use only plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external frameworks). Keep files self-contained so I can paste code into Replit and run it.

Design & Feel:
- Pastel gradients, soft shadows, rounded corners, and cute/romantic styling.
- Smooth fade/slide transitions between pages.
- Playful animated details: confetti, floating balloons, sakura petals, soft sparkles.
- Use a pretty display font for headings and a handwritten-looking font for the letter section. (Use Google Fonts links if necessary.)
- Buttons have hover glow/shadow; icons for sections.
- Make it mobile-friendly and responsive.
- Provide clearly labeled placeholders for images and text so I can edit later.
- Optional: include an audio tag with a placeholder so I can add a birthday song or her favorite track (no external hosting required — it should accept a local file if I upload one to Replit).

Pages / Sections (in order; each is a separate visible “slide”):

1) Greeting Page
- Big heading: “Happy Birthday Rica!”
- Subtitle: “Wishing you the best day ever 💖”
- Animated confetti and floating balloons.
- A colorful “Enter” button that goes to the next page.

2) About Rica Page
- Title: “About You”
- A profile card with image placeholder (circular), name, short tagline placeholder (“Your smile makes days brighter”), and editable fields for favorites (color, flower, food, song, anime character).
- Small icons and a soft pastel background.
- A cute “edit later” note so I know where to change text.

3) Anime Corner Page (Kanade — Angel Beats)
- Title: “Your Anime World 🎬”
- Large image placeholder prefilled with a Kanade-style placeholder image (label it so I can replace it).
- Falling sakura petals animation and a soft glow around the character image.
- Text area: “This character inspires you, just like you inspire me.” (editable)
- A small fact box where I can add lines like “Favorite character: Kanade — Angel Beats” and “Why she’s your fave: ___”.

4) Timeline Page
- Title: “Our 16 Days”
- A simple horizontal or vertical timeline with 16 labeled bubbles (Day 1 → Day 16) and editable text under each bubble.
- Smooth hover reveals or click-to-expand each day’s text.

5) Compliments Page
- Title: “Things I Love About You”
- A heart button; each click reveals one compliment (animate each line in with a heart pop).
- Include at least 10 placeholder compliments (I will edit but code must support showing them one at a time and replaying).
- Add small heart animations and confetti on the final compliment.

6) Gallery Page
- Title: “Little Things You Love”
- Grid of 6 image placeholders (click to open bigger lightbox-style overlay).
- Captions under each image editable.

7) Surprise Page
- Title: “Click for your gift 🎁”
- Large gift button. When clicked it flips or fades to reveal a glowing card containing a heartfelt message.
- The revealed message should include this text: 
  “Rica, I don’t have money to buy you something fancy for your birthday… but I still wanted to give you something from the heart. So I made you a gift I hope you’ll never forget. It may not cost anything, but it has all my effort and care in it. I hope it makes you smile the way you make me smile.”
- Add a small animation (sparkle or glow) around the revealed card.

8) Letter / Poem Page
- Styled like a handwritten note on pretty stationery (soft paper texture background).
- A text area with a sample poem/letter prefilled (editable).
- Option to “Download this message” as a small text file or to copy it to clipboard.

9) Ending Page
- Big final message: “Happy Birthday Rica! 🎉”
- Fireworks or confetti animation and a “Start Over” / “Play Again” button.
- A small footer: “Made with ❤️ by [Your Name]” (editable).

Extra features & dev notes:
- Provide clear comments in the HTML/JS where to replace images/text.
- Keep code well-structured and minimal; avoid external dependencies besides optional Google Fonts.
- Ensure keyboard navigation and accessible buttons (aria-labels).
- All animations should be CSS-based where possible; JS only for page control and interactive bits.
- Provide short instructions at top of the code (within comments) telling me which placeholders to replace (images, text, audio).

Include everything in one copy-pastable deliverable (HTML file or HTML + small CSS/JS files). Make it friendly to edit in Replit.
```

# 2) Ready compliments (copy/paste into Compliments page)

Use these as the initial compliments (they’ll appear one by one when she clicks the heart button):

1. “Your smile makes my day brighter.”
2. “You have the kindest heart I’ve ever seen.”
3. “I love how you care about the little things.”
4. “Your laugh is my favorite sound.”
5. “You make simple moments feel special.”
6. “You’re creative and so thoughtful.”
7. “I admire how strong and gentle you are.”
8. “Talking to you is the highlight of my day.”
9. “You’ve got a beautiful taste in anime (Kanade is perfect).”
10. “I like you — more than I expected.”

# 3) Short poem / letter (for Letter/Poem page)

You can paste this into the Letter page and tweak it if you want:

```
Rica,

Happy Birthday. I don’t have a gift wrapped in a box, but I wrapped this website with care — every page is a small piece of how you make my days better. 
We’ve only known each other a short while, but you’ve already become someone I think about often. Your smile, your laugh, and the things you love (like Kanade) tell me who you are — gentle, strong, and quietly beautiful.

I hope this little book makes you smile. I made it because I wanted you to know you matter — more than you might realize.

Always,
[Your Name]
```

# 4) Pre-message to send her before showing the site

Use this to tell her you made something special despite not having money:

```
Rica — I don’t have money to buy something fancy, but I wanted to give you a gift from my heart. I made you a small website/book for your birthday with things I noticed about you and a surprise inside. Would you like to see it? 💖
```

# 5) Quick casual questions to ask Rica (to personalize the site)

Drop these into chat casually — even one or two answers will help you edit the site:

* “What’s your favorite color and flower?”
* “Is there a photo or screenshot you’d like me to put in the gallery?”
* “Do you have a favorite song I could add to the page?”
* “Why do you like Kanade the most? (I’ll write that in the Anime Corner.)”
* “Is there a small memory from the last 16 days you want on the timeline?”

---

If you want, I can now:

* Paste a complete single-file **HTML + CSS + JS** code mockup right here that matches the prompt (so you can copy-paste into Replit immediately), **OR**
* Tailor the poem/compliments to sound more romantic/playful or more casual/friendly (pick a tone).

Which of those two would help you most next?
